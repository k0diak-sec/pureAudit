# PureAudit 🔒

A Python-based home network security auditing tool built by [PureSecure](https://puresecure.cloud).

PureAudit scans local networks to identify security risks, open ports, and common misconfigurations — helping families and small businesses understand their network exposure.

## Features

- **Network Discovery** — Identifies all active devices on the local network
- **Port Scanning** — Detects open ports and maps them to known services
- **Vulnerability Flagging** — Flags common security misconfigurations (default credentials, open admin panels, unencrypted services)
- **Report Generation** — Outputs a clean, readable security audit report

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Scapy (network packet crafting & sniffing)
- python-nmap (port scanning wrapper)
- Rich (terminal UI & formatted output)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k0diak-sec/pureAudit.git
cd pureAudit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

### Full Security Audit
Network discovery, port scanning, vulnerability analysis, and report generation.
```bash
python src/main.py --audit --target 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Quick Scan
Discovery only — no port scan, no report.
```bash
python src/main.py --scan --target 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Auto-detect Subnet
For standard home networks (non-segmented).
```bash
python src/main.py --audit
```
